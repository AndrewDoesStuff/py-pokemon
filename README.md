# py-pokemon

This is just a cute little thing that I wrote for fun when I was in a [Pokemon Draft League](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYq9kek4JSruns_zL17b9A7yFYldE5EVp_XQIhZyL60/edit?usp=sharing)

Basically the long and short of it is that you use the `main.py` to submit a formatted csv file with whatever types the Pokemon are, and it will spit out a nicely formatted `.txt` file that you can use when you play whoever in your draft leagues in order to not refer to the dual type chart at all times.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Forward your command line to client to the clone'd repository's directory
3. Run the command `python -u main.py`
4. Pass it the location of a correctly formatted csv file [*see the csv files in the repository for examples*]
5. Run it and enjoy!

### Future Additions
- [ ] tkinter based read and write.
- [ ] UI
- [ ] csv writer in proper formatting
- [ ] full search feature?
